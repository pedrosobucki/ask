Sounds good! If you need help with writing to a file in Rust, you can use `std::fs::File` and `std::io::Write`. Here's a quick example:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;

fn main() {
    let mut file = File::create("output.txt").expect("Failed to create file");
    writeln!(file, "Hello, file!").expect("Failed to write to file");
}
```

Let me know if you run into any issues! ðŸš€

It is a command language interpreter and a default shell for most Linux distributions. Bash provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system.

Here's an example of how you can use Bash:\n\nLet's say you want to create a new directory called \"my_directory\" in your current location. You can use the following command in your Bash shell:\n\n```\nmkdir my_directory\n```\n\nThis command will create a new directory named \"my_directory\" in the current directory. You can then navigate into the newly created directory using the `cd` command:\n\n```\ncd my_directory\n```\n\nNow you are inside the \"my_directory\" directory. You can perform various operations like creating files, moving files, or executing other commands within this directory.\n\nBash provides a wide range of commands and functionalities to interact with the system.
